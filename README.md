# Search-in-text
This code serves as an instructional example, illustrating how substring searching can be implemented manually, which is beneficial for understanding underlying algorithms and for educational purposes.

The provided Python code implements a basic substring search algorithm, manually checking if a smaller string (substring) exists within a larger string (main string). It iterates through the main string and compares each segment with the substring to determine if a match exists. This approach is educational, demonstrating the fundamental mechanics of substring searching without relying on built-in functions.

In practical applications, Python offers more efficient and optimized methods for substring searching, such as the in operator and the find() method. These built-in approaches are generally preferred for their simplicity and performance.
